# Chat App

This is a simple chat application built using React, Next.js, Firebase, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to register, log in, and engage in real-time conversations with other users. The app utilizes Firebase Firestore for storing and syncing chat messages, Firebase Authentication for user management, Next.js for server-side rendering, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Firebase: A cloud-based platform for building web and mobile applications.
- Firebase Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing app data in real-time.
- Firebase Authentication: A service that provides user authentication and authorization.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building responsive and customizable UIs.


## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
